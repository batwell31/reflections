How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was very helpful.  It showed the differences, and made it easy to spot out
    the problem.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could compare versions, and see any revisions that were made, and revert back if needed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You get to decide when to create commits.
    Cons: You can easily Commit too much, or too little.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   I think they let us same multiple files due to the fact that this was created for code, 
   and being that JavaScript/CSS/and HTML, and a lot of the code works together.
   
   I think google docs works 1 at a time because of it's purpose.  You make a document, and save it.
   It wasn't really made for code.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can look up what changes have been made, and compare the differences for the deletations and commits. 
    

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It allows you to be able to go back to previous versions of the game.  If you made any new commits durring 
    the checkout process it could really mess things up.  

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  I want to use Git to make it easier to find bugs, and errors in code.  Also just the general knowledge is great.  
  I feel like it's almost needed to know now a days.
