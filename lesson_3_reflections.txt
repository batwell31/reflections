1) When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    You would want to make it remote if you want to share your work, and get feedback.  
    Also, anytime you're in a group project it would need to be remote.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
   stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

        Doing it manually gives you more control, and would cut down on Git making mistakes, or 
        errors, or bugs.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

        Forks:
            - are made when you clone a repository from github to your github acount.

        Clones:
            - are made when you clone a repository from github, or off of a local repository to your local repository.

        Branches:
            - branches navigate through your project, and can even be merged.  They can be for experimental use, or
              if you want to make a different version of the same game.  You can create a different branch.  The main branch
              is called master.  You have to manually make new branches.  if a branch gets deleted you lose the commits unless
              they are obtainable through another branch.
