1) When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    You would want to make it remote if you want to share your work, and get feedback.  
    Also, anytime you're in a group project it would need to be remote.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
   stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

        Doing it manually gives you more control, and would cut down on Git making mistakes, or 
        errors, or bugs.
